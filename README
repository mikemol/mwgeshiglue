This is a MediaWiki extension designed to tie MediaWiki to GeSHi, primarily with the concerns of Rosetta Code's[1] use case. As such, it only uses a subset of GeSHi's available features.

To install:

1) Copy MWGeSHiGlue.php to $IP/extensions/
2) Download GeSHi[2], install to $IP/extensions/geshi/
3) To $IP/LocalSettings.php, add: require_once("$IP/extensions/MWGeSHiGlue.php");

To use:

Wrap your code snippet with tags named <lang>, like so:

<lang perl>use strict;
print "Hello, world!";</lang>

or

<lang bash>echo "Hello, world!";</lang>

to see a list of supported languages (such as might be useful on a documentation page), try:

<lang list></lang>
